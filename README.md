# UnixFinalProject
## Goals
The goal of the project is to setup a VPS server by using knowledge acquired during the semester.

## Why Debian?
The main advantange of Debian over other distros is its stability. For the beginner like me, I value stable VPS more than more features. Aside of that, I worked with Debian during the semester, therefore I will apply my knowledge here.

## Choice of VPS
I had two options for my VPS. One is DigitalOcean and the another is OVHcloud. Ultimately I chose DigitalOcean.
