# UnixFinalProject
## Goals
The goal of the project is to setup a VPS server by using knowledge acquired during the semester.

## Why Debian?
The main advantange of Debian over other distros is its stability. For the beginner like me, I value stable VPS more than more features. Aside of that, I worked with Debian during the semester, therefore I will apply my knowledge here.

## Choice of VPS
I had two options for my VPS. One is DigitalOcean and the another is OVHcloud. Ultimately I chose DigitalOcean for several reasons. It is one of the most known hosting services. It has an affordable price and is easy to setup. Both DigitalOcean and OVHcloud have an excellent performance as well. Compared to OVHcloud, DigitalOcean is more secure and has more features. They are similar overval, but DigitalOcean shows a better performance and is better in the long run.
